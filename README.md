# CS-320-Reflection
To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I start by implementing thorough testing, including unit, integration, and security testing, while following best practices for coding and security, such as input validation, encryption, and regular code reviews. Interpreting user needs involves actively engaging with users through interviews, surveys, and feedback sessions to understand their requirements and pain points, and then translating these insights into clear, actionable features. When designing software, I adopted an iterative approach by creating prototypes, gathering feedback, and refining the design, while ensuring scalability, usability, and maintainability are central to the architecture, with a strong emphasis on user experience and performance.
